## About me

I'm a Software Engineer with experience as Developer and DevOps. The technologies I have worked with are DotNet, Terraform and AWS. For the last one, I have the Developer Associate certification. I define myself as a challenge-seeker person and team player. I simply give it all to deliver high-quality solutions. On the other hand, I like to analyze and improve processes, promote [productivity](https://cangulo.github.io/blog/tags/productivity) and [document implementations](https://cangulo.github.io/meetups/vscode-for-documentation) (yes, I'm a developer that likes to document üßë‚Äçüíª).
